          <p>So you submitted your bot. What now? Check out <Link to={`/tournaments/${TOURNAMENT_ID}/ranks`}>the leaderboard</Link> to see how well your bot is doing! After submitting, you will need to give our servers some time to get around to scheduling matches for your bot.</p>
          <p>The way we rank players is through the Trueskill ranking system developed by Microsoft. You have 3 values associated with your ranking, a score, a mu (¬µ), and a sigma (œÉ)</p>
          <p>Mu represents our absolute measure of your player's skill. Sigma represents our confidence in that measure, with lower meaning higher confidence. Your score is then calculated as ¬µ - 3 * œÉ and all players are ranked according to that</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h1 className='statement'>Prizes üèÜ</h1>
          <p>At the moment, we have two prizes of $30 Amazon Gift cards for two categories</p>
          <h3 className='prize-title'>Overall Winner</h3>
          <p>$30 Amazon Gift card given to the highest ranking player. An email with the code will be sent to the player and will be recorded in ACM AI's history books!</p>

          <p>$30 Amazon Gift card given to competitor who demonstrates (without actually doing anything malicious) the best reproducible hack into our competition systems. An email with the code will be sent to the player and will be recorded in ACM AI's history books!</p>
