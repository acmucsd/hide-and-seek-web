          <p>The way we rank players is through the Trueskill ranking system developed by Microsoft. You have 3 values associated with your ranking, a score, a mu (¬µ), and a sigma (œÉ)</p>
          <p>Mu represents our absolute measure of your player's skill. Sigma represents our confidence in that measure, with lower meaning higher confidence. Your score is then calculated as ¬µ - 3 * œÉ and all players are ranked according to that</p>

          <p>$30 Amazon Gift card given to the highest ranking player. An email with the code will be sent to the player and will be recorded in ACM AI's history books!</p>
